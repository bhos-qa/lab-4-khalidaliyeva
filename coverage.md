Statement coverage ensures that every line of code in a program is executed at least once during testing. It helps identify sections of code that were never executed, but it doesn't guarantee full coverage of all logical conditions.

Branch coverage (or decision coverage) tests all possible paths of decision points, such as if or switch statements. It ensures that both the true and false branches are covered, giving a better understanding of how the code behaves under different conditions.

Predicate coverage focuses on the evaluation of boolean expressions within decisions. It ensures that every possible outcome of each sub-expression (predicate) is tested, providing deeper insight into complex logical conditions compared to branch coverage.
